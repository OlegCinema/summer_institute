# Food in Shanghai

Shanghai cuisine is mildly sweet and braised. Typical breakfast items cost ¥6–15. A set lunch in a mid-range chain runs ¥35 – 80; dinner in a reputable Shanghainese restaurant, ¥120 – 200 per person.

Because Shanghai is a migrant city, every major Chinese cuisine is represented. Common, reliable choices:
1. Sichuan (chuancai): spicy hot-pot, mapo tofu, dry-fried chicken.
2. Cantonese (yuecai): dim sum, roast goose, congee; look for Crystal Jade or Guangzhou Hotel chains.
3. North-western halal (qingzhen): Lanzhou hand-pulled beef noodles, cumin lamb kebabs; green halal logo at the door. Prices ¥25–40 for a large bowl.

> Night-market stalls at Shouning Road or university areas are licensed and generally safe; avoid seafood skewers that sit at room temperature. Carry hand wipes, and drink only sealed bottled water or boiled tea, because **tap water is not potable**.

Most eateries use QR menus: scan with Alipay or WeChat. Few staff speak fluent English; point at photos or show dish names in Chinese characters saved on your phone. **Tips are not expected and sometimes politely refused**.

*Meituan* and *Ele.me* require a Chinese phone number and ID; ask the hotel front desk to place orders if you want takeaway. Convenience stores (FamilyMart, Lawson) stock onigiri, cold noodles, fruit and electrolyte drinks that can be useful during July heat.
