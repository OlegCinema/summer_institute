# Internet and VPN using

China blocks most global services (Google, YouTube, WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, many news sites). The filtering is city-wide in Shanghai. Pages outside the mainland load slowly even when not blocked.

VPNs that are not on the government’s whitelist are technically illegal for providers but tolerated for individual users; **tourists are not prosecuted**, but the connection can drop without warning. Install and test a paid, well-known VPN before landing, because app stores inside China often hide or disable download links.

Mainland SIM cards require passport registration and a Chinese address; activation takes 10–15 min at China Mobile/China Unicom counters in both airports. Packages start at ¥100 for 20 GB. Russian roaming (with a pre-installed VPN) is simpler, data speeds are lower but no ID steps. 

If you have foreign bank cards, we recommend buy E-SIMs before departure (for example, *Airalo*).
