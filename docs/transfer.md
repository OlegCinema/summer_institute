# Transfer to the hotel

## Taxi
Taxis in China are generally cheaper than in Russia, but you need Alipay with the DiDi mini-service (China’s Uber/Yandex Go) and either wallet funds or a linked, unsanctioned Visa/Mastercard/UnionPay card.

Set your pick-up point to the airport arrivals hall and your destination to Hilton Garden Inn Shanghai Caoyang.
* Pudong (PVG) ➜ hotel: €20 – 30, depending on demand.
* Hongqiao (SHA) ➜ hotel: about €10.

## Public transport (from PVG)

Most international flights, including Aeroflot, land at PVG.
1. Maglev: follow the signs to the [Maglev](https://www.chinaairlinetravel.com/airport-guide/shanghai-airport/pudong-airport-maglevtrain.htm) station, buy a ticket (about €6) at the counter or with Alipay, ride 10 min to Longyang Road.

## Public Transport (from SHA)

SHA is much closer to the hotel, so a DiDi/taxi (€10) is simplest.

By metro:
1. From Hongqiao Airport T1 station take Line 10 to Jiaotong University (20 min).
2. Transfer at the same station to Line 11 and continue to Fengqiao Road (15 min).
3. Walk 11 min to the hotel.
